# Project: System testing using Selenium

In this milestone, we've wrapped the internal workings of our TODO app (which we have tested in the previous milestone) into a web app. We will use Selenium to automate the testing process (that is, visiting specific URLs, filling up information in forms and clicking bottons).

Here is an outline of what we are doing:

0. Start the TODO web app in the terminal and run the `FirstSeleniumTest.java` for sanity checks.

1. Identify flows through the TODO website.

2. For each flow create a separate test file with an appropriate name like `RetrieveTODOsFlowTest.java`.

3. Pick a flow to test (for example, retrieve TODOs). Identify the different webpages involved in this flow and create Java objects for each page inside the `pages` folder. Use these webpage objects in our testfile to test the flow. 

4. Proceed to another flow.
