## Milestone 3: System testing using Selenium

In this milestone, we've wrapped the internal workings of our TODO app (which we have tested in the previous milestone) into a web app. You will use Selenium to automate the testing process (that is, visiting specific URLs, filling up information in forms and clicking bottons).

Here is an outline of the work you need to do for this milestone:

0. Start the TODO web app in the terminal and run the `FirstSeleniumTest.java` for sanity checks to make sure that you are able to run the Safari browser.

1. Identify flows through the TODO website.

2. For each flow create a separate test file with an appropriate name like `RetrieveTODOsFlowTest.java`.

3. Pick a flow to test (for example, retrieve TODOs). Identify the different webpages involved in this flow and create Java objects for each page inside the `pages` folder. Use these webpage objects in your testfile to test the flow. 

4. Proceed to another flow.
